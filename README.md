# üèÄ NBA Draft Lab ‚Äî Lottery Simulation & Prospect Profiles

Predict the NBA lottery (picks 1‚Äì14) by matching teams to prospects using historical team needs, prospect quality, and draft logic ‚Äî plus interactive prospect profiles with radar charts and NBA-style comps.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a learning-focused project. Accuracy is still modest, but the repo shows end-to-end skills: data collection & cleaning, feature engineering, clustering, simulation, evaluation, and a Streamlit frontend.

## ‚ú® What‚Äôs inside

- **Streamlit app** for profiles & simulation (`app/streamlit_app.py`)
- **ML modules** (`ml/`) for profiles, simulation, weights, playstyles, etc.
- **Data & weights** (`data/processed/<year>/‚Ä¶`, `weights/‚Ä¶`)
- **Notebooks** for scraping / exploration (`notebooks/`)
- **Reproducible env** via `requirements.txt` / `environment.dev.yml`

## üìä Project scope

**Objective.** Simulate the lottery part of the NBA Draft: for each pick, score all remaining team‚Äìprospect pairs, select the best fit, remove the player, and continue until pick 14.

Two key surfaces:

1. **Prospect Profiles**
   - Per-game & advanced stat **radar charts**
   - **Z-score ‚Üí min‚Äìmax** scaling for fair visual comparison
   - Optional **Upside** and **UpdatedOverall** scores
   - **NBA comps & archetype** when comps CSV exists

2. **Draft Simulation (2020-2024)**
   - Uses **current weight files** when present, otherwise defaults
   - Reports **Team-match accuracy**, **Lottery hit rate**, **MRR**, and **nDCG@14**

## üß± Data sources & scraping

Data is built via notebooks and scripts under `notebooks/`, saved as yearly processed CSVs under `data/processed/<year>/‚Ä¶`.

- **Prospects (college, international, OTE, G League Ignite):**
  Scraped from public sites (e.g., RealGM, NBA G League stats, OvertimeElite.com), cleaned to a unified schema.
- **Combine measurements:**
  Pulled from public NBA stats pages.
- **Mock draft signal:**
  **Tankathon** profiles used to fill gaps.
- **Team context:**
  Season summaries (ratings, record, depth, timeline) compiled per year.

Processed outputs:
- `draftpool_stats_<year>.csv` (core dataset)
- Optional enrichments:
  - `prospect_profiles_with_upside_<year>.csv`
  - `prospect_comps_<year>.csv`

## üß† Modeling & techniques

### Prospect scoring & profiles
- **Standardisation & scaling:** z-scores ‚Üí min‚Äìmax [0,1] for radars
- **Composite score:** weighted blend of per-game index, advanced index, and **age bonus**
- **Archetypes & comps:**
  - KMeans/PCA+KMeans clustering for playstyle tags
  - KNN-style nearest-neighbor comps to recent NBA players

### Draft simulation
- **Stateful process:** pick-by-pick, removing selected players
- **Fit features:** team positional needs √ó position, shooting/defense/rebounding needs √ó metrics, **timeline fit** (age), mock-delta
- **Score blending:** separate weight vectors for **college** vs **non-college** cohorts
- **Evaluation metrics:** Team-match accuracy, Lottery hit rate, MRR, nDCG@14

### Optimisation & experiments
- **Bayesian optimisation** of weight vectors (`scikit-optimize`)
- **Cluster-aware adjustments** to down-weight archetypes that overperform in college but under-translate to the NBA
